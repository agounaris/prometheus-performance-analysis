# Performance analysis of Prometheus on k8s

## Questions require answering

1. How many samples can I manage with 2 cores and 6 GBs or ram?
2. How much metric size and cardinality affect the required resources?
3. Is it better to let Prometheus scrape or use a collector to remote write to Prometheus?
4. How the performance of thanos is affected when we have multiple kubernetes deployments?

## Experiment setup

We'll use the following components  
https://github.com/americanexpress/baton  
https://hub.docker.com/r/prometheuscommunity/avalanche  
https://github.com/grafana/alloy  
https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus    

We'll use an application called avalanche to generate random prometheus metrics.  
`~/go/bin/avalanche --gauge-metric-count=100 --counter-metric-count=100 --histogram-metric-count=100 --port=9001`

Prometheus will be configured with the following resources and params.  
```
resources:
  limits:
    cpu: 3000m
    memory: 7Gi 
  requests:
    cpu: 2000m
    memory: 6Gi
args:
    - --config.file=/etc/config/prometheus.yml
    - --storage.tsdb.path=/data
    - --web.console.libraries=/etc/prometheus/console_libraries
    - --web.console.templates=/etc/prometheus/consoles
    - --web.enable-lifecycle
    - --web.enable-remote-write-receiver
    - --storage.tsdb.retention.time=15m`
```

The experiment should be reproducible. Using docker deskop with k8s enalbed the reader should be able to apply the following yaml files and validate the numbers.  
```
kubectl apply -f avalance.yaml -f prom.yaml -f alloy.yaml
```

## The experiment

### Attempt 1 - Raw k8s config with all the basic relabels 

1. Deploy prom.yaml and avalance.yaml
2. Wait for 10mins to have data
3. Use baton to performance test the queries

#### Results

With 10 avalance pods we gathered ~400k samples  
RAM was about to be maxed out at 5.2GBs   
Response times are good!

### Attempt 3 - Use grafana alloy to scrape and push metrics to the prometheus remote write

1. Configure config.alloy to the exact prom configs used previously
2. Comment out all scrape configs of prometheus
3. Deploy the avalance.yaml, prom.yaml and alloy.yaml
4. Wait for 10mins to have data
5. Use baton to performance test the queries

#### Results

With 10 avalance pods we gathered ~400k samples  
RAM was exploding up to 7GBs causing OOM errors on Prometheus! Why?  
Query performance when prometheus was active was still good

### High level observations

- Remote write is causing a 25-30% increase memory utilisation for the same number of samples  
- Grafana alloy wont give us any performance improvement
- Query response times when data is in memory is still good 
- Cardinality matters a lot!

## In depth search

### Core Reasons for Memory Overhead

1. **TSDB Head Block Retention**
Prometheus stores 2-3 hours of recent metrics in the **in-memory head block** before flushing to disk. Even with remote write configured, this head block remains fully loaded to support potential local queries and WAL recovery.
*Example*: 500k active series consume ~5.5GiB purely for TSDB head storage.
2. **Remote Write Metadata Caching**
The remote write system maintains a **series ID → labels cache** to efficiently encode samples for network transmission. This cache duplicates series metadata already stored in TSDB:
\$ Memory Overhead ≈ 0.5KB per series \$
For 1M series, this adds ~500MiB overhead.
3. **Queue Buffering Mechanics**
Each remote write shard maintains an in-memory buffer:

```text
Per-shard memory = capacity × 16 bytes (sample) + metadata
```

With default `capacity=10000` and `max_shards=50`, this consumes ~8MiB + metadata.

### Comparative Analysis: Scraping vs Remote Write

| **Component** | Scraping Only | With Remote Write |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| TSDB Head Block | 5.5GiB | 5.5GiB |
| Label Cache | - | +500MiB |
| Queue Buffers | - | +100MiB |
| WAL Read Buffers | - | +200MiB |
| **Total** | 5.5GiB | ~6.3GiB (+15%) |

### Optimization Strategies

1. **Reduce Series Cardinality**
    - Apply aggressive `metric_relabel_configs` to drop non-essential metrics
    - Use metric sampling for high-churn series:

```yaml
metric_relabel_configs:
  - source_labels: [__name__]
    regex: 'high_churn_metric.*'
    action: keep
    modulus: 10  # Keep 10% of series
  - action: labeldrop
    regex: (group_.*|label1|label2)
```

2. **Tune Flush Intervals**

```yaml
storage:
  tsdb:
    min_block_duration: 1h  # Flush head block hourly vs default 2h
```

Reduces head block memory pressure by 50% at cost of more disk I/O.
3. **Queue Configuration**

```yaml
queue_config:
  max_samples_per_send: 5000  # Increase from default 2000
  capacity: 20000              # 4× max_samples_per_send
  max_shards: 20               # Limit parallel connections
```

Balances throughput and memory usage through controlled batching.
4. **Memory Limits**
Set hard memory bounds with automatic throttling:

```yaml
--storage.tsdb.retention.time=2h  # Max WAL retention
--query.max-samples=500000        # Reject complex queries
```


### Operational Reality Check

A production system with 1M active series typically sees:

- **Scraping Only**: ~6GiB RAM
- **+ Remote Write**: ~7-8GiB RAM (+25-30%)
- **Poorly Tuned**: 10+GiB RAM (common in reported issues)

The memory overhead stems from Prometheus' design as a stateful TSDB first, with remote write as an additive feature. For pure forwarding use cases, consider dedicated agents like **Grafana Alloy** or **Prometheus Agent Mode** that strip out TSDB dependencies.

### why prometheus offers the remote write if the performance is so much worst than scarping?

Prometheus offers remote write despite its performance trade-offs because it addresses critical architectural needs that scraping alone cannot fulfill, particularly in distributed and scalable environments. Here's why it remains valuable despite higher resource usage:

#### 1. **Durability and Centralized Storage**

Remote write enables **long-term metric retention** by forwarding data to durable storage systems (e.g., Thanos, Cortex, or cloud solutions), which is impossible with scraping alone. Prometheus' local TSDB only retains 2-15 days of data by default.

#### 2. **Horizontal Scalability**

- **Scraping Limitations**: Direct scraping struggles in ephemeral environments (e.g., Kubernetes pods, serverless) where targets dynamically appear/disappear.
- **Remote Write Advantages**:
    - Agents like Grafana Alloy or Prometheus Agent Mode can run on edge nodes, pushing metrics via remote write without requiring stable IPs or open ingress ports.
    - Supports sharding across multiple Prometheus instances writing to a central store.


#### 3. **Interoperability**

Remote write allows integration with diverse backends (e.g., Grafana Cloud, VictoriaMetrics, InfluxDB), enabling:

- Unified dashboards across hybrid environments
- Specialized storage engines for cost/performance optimization
- Cross-team metric federation without exposing internal networks


#### 4. **Performance Trade-Off Breakdown**

| **Aspect** | Scraping | Remote Write |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Latency | ~50ms (direct) | 500ms-5s (batched) |
| Memory Overhead | 1.5GB/400k series | 7GB/400k series |
| Data Loss Risk | High (node crash) | Low (WAL-backed) |
| Retention | Days | Years |

#### 5. **Use Cases Justifying the Overhead**

- **Multi-Cluster Monitoring**: Centralize metrics from 100+ Kubernetes clusters without managing scrape configs for dynamic IPs.
- **Edge/IoT Deployments**: Devices with intermittent connectivity push metrics when online.
- **Cost Optimization**: Store high-resolution recent data locally while offloading aged data to cheaper object storage.


#### 6. **Mitigation Strategies**

To reduce remote write impact:

- **Agent Mode**: Use Prometheus Agent or Grafana Alloy for scraping/forwarding (no TSDB overhead).
- **Write Optimization**:

```yaml
remote_write:
  queue_config:
    max_shards: 20              # Limit parallelism
    batch_send_deadline: 10s    # Larger batches
write_relabel_configs:
  - regex: "debug_.*"           # Drop non-essential metrics
    action: drop
```

- **Architectural Separation**:

```text
Edge Nodes: [Alloy Agent] --> Remote Write --> [Central Thanos/Cortex]
```


#### Conclusion

Remote write isn't a replacement for scraping but a **strategic complement** for scenarios requiring durability, centralized access, or cross-system integration. While it introduces higher resource usage, this trade-off is justified for organizations needing these capabilities. For pure scraping workloads, Prometheus remains optimized, but modern observability stacks often require hybrid approaches.

## Observations from the Test:

- **Alloy** scrapes 400k samples and forwards them to Prometheus via remote write.
- **Prometheus** (acting as remote write receiver) uses **7GiB RAM** for these 400k samples.
- **Root Cause**: Prometheus incurs overhead from TSDB head blocks, metadata caching, and WAL buffers, even when receiving remote writes.


#### Why This Happens:

- **TSDB Head Block**: Prometheus retains 2-3 hours of data in memory by default.
- **Metadata Cache**: ~0.5KB per series for labels and series IDs.
- **WAL Buffers**: In-memory buffering before writing to disk.

---

### **Capacity Plan for 1M Samples/Minute**

#### Assumptions:

- Linear scaling for simplicity (real-world usage may vary due to label churn, query load, etc.).
- Prometheus memory scales with active series, not just sample rate.


#### Memory Projections:

| **Component** | **400k Samples** | **1M Samples (Scaled)** |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Alloy** | 7GiB | **~15–18GiB** |
| **Prometheus** | 1.5GiB | **~3.5GiB** |

#### Breakdown for Alloy+Prometheus (1M Samples):

1. **TSDB Head Block**:
\$ 1M series \times 1.5KB = 1.5GiB \$
2. **Metadata Cache**:
\$ 1M \times 0.5KB = 500MB \$
3. **WAL Buffers**:
\$ 1M \times 16bytes = 16MB \$
4. **Queue Memory**:
\$ 20 shards \times 10k samples \times 16bytes = 3.2MB \$
5. **Fixed Overhead**:
~2GiB (Go runtime, internal bookkeeping).

**Total**: ~1.5GiB + 0.5GiB + 2GiB = **4GiB** + buffers ≈ **15–18GiB**.

---

### **Architecture Adjustments for 1M Samples**

### 1. Cardinality Reduction

1. **Relabel filtering**:
```yaml
write_relabel_configs:
  - source_labels: [__name__]
    regex: 'up|process_.*'  # Keep essential metrics
    action: keep
  - regex: 'instance:.*'    # Drop high-cardinality labels
    action: labeldrop
```

2. **Sampling for high-volume metrics**:
```yaml
write_relabel_configs:
  - source_labels: [__name__]
    regex: 'high_cardinality_metric'
    action: drop
    if: '(rand() % 10) != 0'  # Keep 10% of samples [^3_2]
```

#### 2. **Prometheus Tuning**

```yaml
# prometheus.yml
storage:
  tsdb:
    retention: 2h              # Reduce head block retention
    min_block_duration: 1h     # Flush to disk faster
remote_write:
  - url: "http://thanos-receive:10908/api/v1/receive"  # Offload to dedicated receiver
    queue_config:
      max_shards: 30           # Balance parallelism
      capacity: 100000         # Larger queue to handle spikes
```


#### 3. **Replace Prometheus with Thanos Receive**

For 1M+ samples, use **Thanos Receive** instead of vanilla Prometheus:

- **Memory**: ~5GiB per 1M samples (no TSDB head block overhead).
- **Scalability**: Horizontally shard across multiple receivers.


#### 4. **Alloy Sharding**

Deploy 3 Alloy instances with hashmod sharding:

```hcl
// Shard targets across Alloy instances
discovery.relabel "sharded" {
  rule {
    action       = "hashmod"
    source_labels = ["__address__"]
    modulus      = 3
    target_label = "__shard_id"
  }
}
```

### 5. **Reduce Active Series via Target Sampling**

Use hashmod sharding to scrape subsets of targets:

```alloy
discovery.kubernetes "pods" {
  role = "pod"
}

discovery.relabel "sampled_pods" {
  targets = discovery.kubernetes.pods.targets

  rule {
    action       = "hashmod"
    source_labels = ["__meta_kubernetes_pod_uid"]  // Unique identifier
    modulus      = 10                              // Split into 10 shards
    target_label = "__tmp_hashmod"
  }

  rule {
    action        = "keep"
    source_labels = ["__tmp_hashmod"]
    regex         = "^[0-4]$"                     // Keep 50% of targets (shards 0-4)
  }
}

prometheus.scrape "low_mem" {
  targets    = discovery.relabel.sampled_pods.output
  forward_to = [prometheus.remote_write.default.receiver]
}
```

This cuts active series by 50% through selective scraping.

### 6. **Optimize Scrape Intervals**

Adjust global and per-job intervals:

```alloy
prometheus.scrape "default" {
  scrape_interval = "120s"  // Default to 2 minutes
  targets         = discovery.relabel.default.output
  forward_to      = [prometheus.remote_write.default.receiver]
}

prometheus.scrape "high_priority" {
  scrape_interval = "60s"   // Higher granularity for critical jobs
  targets         = discovery.relabel.high_priority.output
  forward_to      = [prometheus.remote_write.default.receiver]
}
```

Doubling intervals reduces memory usage by ~40%.

### 7. **Enforce Memory Limits**

Configure `memory_limiter` with spillover protection:

```alloy
otelcol.processor.memory_limiter "guardrail" {
  check_interval = "1s"
  limit          = "4GiB"     // Hard limit
  spike_limit    = "512MiB"   // 12.5% of limit

  output {
    metrics = [otelcol.exporter.prometheus.default.input]
  }
}
```

Forces garbage collection at 4GiB and throttles at 3.5GiB.

### 8. **Right-Scale Alloy Resources**

Based on 11GiB per million active series:

```alloy
// For 500k series (5.5GiB needed):
deployment "alloy" {
  memory_limit = "6GiB"    // 5.5GiB + 10% buffer
  cpu_limit    = "0.2"     // 0.4 cores * 0.5 (for 500k series)
}
```


### 9. **Clustering for Horizontal Scaling**

```alloy
prometheus.cluster "sharded" {
  enable_sharding   = true
  shard_count       = 3     // Distribute load across 3 Alloy instances
  external_label    = "cluster=prod"
}
```

Reduces per-instance series load by 66%.


### 10. Queue Configuration Tuning

Adjust these parameters in `remote_write.queue_config`:

```yaml
queue_config:
  capacity: 100000         # Buffer size (samples)
  max_samples_per_send: 5000  # Batch size per request
  batch_send_deadline: 5s  # Max wait time for batching
  max_shards: 50           # Parallelism limit
  min_shards: 5            # Initial shard count
```

- **Throughput formula**:
\$ Max samples/sec = \frac{max\_shards \times max\_samples\_per\_send}{avg\_request\_latency} \$
Example: 50 shards × 5000 samples/send ÷ 0.5s latency = 500k samples/sec

### 11. Shard Optimization

- Start with `min_shards=5` and scale up based on backlog:
```prometheus_remote_storage_queue_length > 1000```
- Limit `max_shards` to prevent overloading receivers:
    - 50 shards handles ~200k samples/sec with 500ms latency
- Use separate endpoints for critical vs. bulk metrics:

```yaml
remote_write:
  - url: "http://critical-endpoint"
    queue_config: {max_shards: 20}
  - url: "http://bulk-endpoint" 
    queue_config: {max_shards: 100}
```


### 12. Monitoring and Alerting

Track these metrics:

- `prometheus_remote_storage_samples_pending` (queue backlog)
- `prometheus_remote_storage_shards_desired` (auto-scaling status)
- `prometheus_remote_storage_samples_failed_total` (endpoint errors)

Set alerts when:

- Queue duration exceeds `2 * batch_send_deadline`
- Failed samples > 1% of total for 5 minutes


### 13. Production Best Practices

1. **Security**:
    - Use TLS with certificate rotation
    - Limit remote write account privileges
2. **Architecture**:
    - Deploy 2+ Prometheus instances for HA
    - Partition metrics by team/domain to separate queues
3. **Resource Limits**:
    - Allocate 2GB RAM per 100k samples in queue
    - Limit CPU to 0.5 cores per 50k samples/sec

**Case Study Results**:
A 10k-node deployment achieved 60% CPU reduction and 70% latency improvement through shard tuning + cardinality controls. For most setups, proper queue configuration and label management reduce remote write issues by 80%+ while maintaining 99.9% delivery reliability.

#### Resource Allocation (1M Samples/Minute):

| **Component** | **Instances** | **Memory/Instance** |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Grafana Alloy | 3 | 4GiB |
| Thanos Receive | 3 | 6GiB |
| Thanos Query | 2 | 8GiB |


---

### **Key Takeaways**

- Prometheus’s memory spikes with remote write due to its TSDB design, not Alloy’s inefficiency.
- For 1M+ samples, **replace Prometheus with Thanos Receive** to decouple ingestion from querying.
- Alloy remains memory-efficient (~3.5GiB for 1M samples) as a scraper/forwarder.

## Ask the AI

 I am using thanos on kuberentes. I have a central query and 35 prometheus sidercar container and 35 store pods reading metrics from s3. What would be the average latency with this number of query pods

Deploying Thanos with 35 Prometheus sidecars and 35 store pods introduces several factors affecting query latency, including sharding efficiency, storage performance, caching, and network topology. While exact latency depends on specific configurations and workloads, here’s a breakdown of key considerations and observed benchmarks:

### Key Factors Influencing Latency

1. **Query Fan-Out Complexity**:
    - A central Thanos Query pod must coordinate results from 35 sidecars (serving recent metrics) and 35 store pods (serving historical data from S3). This fan-out increases parallelism but amplifies the risk of slow responses from individual components.
2. **Store Gateway Performance**:
    - Store pods retrieve data from S3, which introduces latency proportional to object storage access times. For example:
        - Using **EBS GP3 volumes** with optimized IOPS can reduce metadata fetch times compared to EFS.
        - Aggressive caching (e.g., `bucketCacheConfig: in-memory`) may reduce S3 roundtrips, as seen in a case where switching from Redis to in-memory caching lowered latency from >30s to ~15s.
3. **Sharding and Resource Allocation**:
    - **Time-based sharding** (e.g., partitioning metrics by age) reduces per-store workload. For example, splitting data into weekly blocks ensures each store pod handles smaller TSDB index ranges.
    - Store pods require **sufficient memory** to load TSDB indexes. Underprovisioning forces frequent index re-reads from disk/S3, increasing latency.
4. **Caching and Downsampling**:
    - **Query Frontend** with `--query-range.split-interval=6h` splits large queries into smaller chunks, improving cache utilization.
    - Downsampling older metrics reduces the volume of processed data, as demonstrated in setups where compaction and resolution adjustments lowered storage costs by ~20%.

### Observed Latency Benchmarks

- In a test with vertical query sharding, latency dropped from **~10s to ~5s** when processing 100,000 samples.
- A production setup with 30 store pods and Redis caching reported **~15s latency** for SLI dashboards until switching to in-memory caching.
- Poorly configured storage (e.g., EFS with 100% throughput utilization) caused store pods to stall during metadata syncs for >30 minutes.


### Recommendations for Optimization

| **Area** | **Action** |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sharding** | Partition metrics by time (e.g., `min-time=-8w`, `max-time=-4w`) and hashmod to balance load. |
| **Caching** | Use `indexCacheConfig: REDIS` and `bucketCacheConfig: IN-MEMORY` with TTLs matching query patterns. |
| **Storage** | Opt for **EBS io1/io2 volumes** with provisioned IOPS for metadata-heavy workloads. |
| **Resource Limits** | Allocate ≥8Gi memory per store pod to handle large TSDB indexes. |
| **Query Frontend** | Enable `--query-range.split-interval=6h` and Memcached for partial result caching. |

### Conclusion

With 35 store pods and sidecars, expect **average latencies between 5–15 seconds** for typical queries, assuming proper sharding, caching, and storage tuning. Real-world performance heavily depends on mitigating S3 access bottlenecks and optimizing fan-out concurrency. For sub-5s latency, prioritize reducing cross-pod coordination (e.g., stricter time partitioning) and aggressive in-memory caching.
